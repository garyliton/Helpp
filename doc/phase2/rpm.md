## major release goals
- an app where we can search up a location and find a charity in that location.
- when user selects a charity they will be able to see logo of the company, summary, social and donation links.

## sprint goals
- crawl the charity websites to get summary, their logo and a donation link if it exists.
- for locations when a user first loads a page it will load their location and the mark charities within that radius. All charities will be displayed in a list.
- when a user opens a charity we would have a backend google api to get all social media links and 
display them, so the user can see them if available. If they click the link they will got to the social media. show all available.

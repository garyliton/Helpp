Communication is something that we need to really focus on in the next sprint as we integrate the different parts of the application into one application. Something that we need to improve on is cohesion of our work, as in the past 2 sprints, our work was disjoint, therefore, we have to spend extra effor this sprint to make every part work with each other.

# Done

After our group gathered to discuss the standards that we have to satisfy in order to conclude that our project is done, we have come to a general consesus regarding what those standards are. First and foremost, our charity application must run on any android device free of bugs. Secondly, a new user should be able to sign up using a gmail account and any user must have the capability to customize their profile. This includes, entering the user's first and last name, upload a profile picture, enter a bio, etc. Thirdly, our app must be capable of recognizing the user's current location and the nearby charities. Moreover, the user should be able to specify a desired radius for tracking charities. These information should be visually available in the form of a map or a list view. The user should have control of what/how he/she wants the data to be displayed, ie. sort alphabetically, by distance, etc. The charities we store in our database must include information such as, charity name, logo, address, website, phone number, etc. becuase we want these charities to be as accessible as possible to the user. Furthermore, each charity must have a rating associated with it and a list of reviews written by other users to provide a better understand of what each charity is really all about. Last but not the least, the point system needs to be implemented. The point system is allows a user to earn points by watch ads from google adsense and these points can be used towards any charity and these points converts to real world currency. In conclusion, If these criteria are met then we are done.

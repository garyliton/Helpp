## What makes us different:
What makes our app different is the fact that users can give back using in app points by watching ads within the app as well as attened charity events in your area.

When logged in, users can watch ads provided by Google AdSense which will give them in-app points. These points directly translate to the ad revenue generated 
by the very ads they watched. Then the user can choose which charity they would like to donate their points/ads revenue towards. This provides users who personally 
donâ€™t have the ability to give back an opportunity to still make the positive impact they desire.

Within our app you can also see past charity or volunteering events you have completed or atteneded.

Our app is better, compared to Eventbrite, for people who want want to give back even more even though they can't. Eventbrite is definatly very similar to our app,
but they do not have the in app points you get by watching ads. We think that they did not focus on this as there would be some form of transaction involved.
However this wouldn't be a big problem as most if not all charities have some for donation option availble anyways. 

Our app is better than Give 2 Charity beacuse we have more charaities in our database to dontate to. Our app also give users an option to attened charity events.
Give 2 Charity might not have included many charaities since they would have to contact or make arrangements with them. With our app we show listings and it is up to
user to contact them.

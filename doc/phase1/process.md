## Organization and Communication
In order to organize the team, we decided to have two different mediums as methods of communication. For more casual discussions such as the brainstorming of ideas, we decided to form a Facebook messenger group while more serious discussion regarding task allocation, meeting scheduling and links to other shared forms where done using Slack.  

## Decisions/Prioritizing user stories
In order to create our user stories, we first decided to have the product owner create a list of all desired features within a Google docs file. This was the designing phase where the group waited for this list to be completed for a week before assembling for a meeting. Keep in mind all these features where rough ideas/suggestions so the goal of this meeting was for the group to come together and discuss the practical execution of these ideas. After leaving this meeting, the user stories where discussed and three members were assigned to put them into the user stories form onto EasyBacklog. A week later, we had another group meeting to discuss assigning priorities, story points, and sprint 1 task allocations. What we did was have a casual discussion where someone in the group would say a user story and anyone who had an opinion on what values to give would speak up. If there was a disagreement, opposing parties would present their cases and arguments. Most of the time, one side would be able to convince the others, but on the few occasions where this consensus could not be reached, the average of all remaining value options was taken.

## Meetings
As we have a large group, it is difficult to schedule an in-person meeting with everyone present, however, we were able to do so once a week. Outside of that, we had many subsequent smaller meetings involving only a few members of the group at a time. These meetings were still very productive as those who were absent had roles independent of the subject of the meeting. For example, those meetings for sprint 0 consists of UI/UX design, finding where our data would come from, exploring competitive products to name a few.
The large group meeting every week was meant to check up on everyone's progress and address any concerns with the direction of the project. However, this shortage of in-person meetings has not been a major deterrent due to very active communication over our two aforementioned group chats on a near-daily basis. Everyone has made sure to update each other on ideas or concerns we had for the project.

## Next phase
For the next phase of this project we will continue to communicate through a messenger, but maybe meet up in person more often, 
to establish a better workflow. There was a slight miscommunication online with writing user stories and the same was written twice. 
If we were to meet up a bit more maybe we could avoid this in the future. Also, we should make a schedule for each of us to make sure we meet deadlines for future sprints.
